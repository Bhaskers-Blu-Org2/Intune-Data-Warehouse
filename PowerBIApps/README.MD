# Intune Data Warehouse Power BI Apps

Power BI apps are available in two different forms. The Power BI apps themselves can be installed from [Microsoft AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us). After installation, you can explore them with the included sample data, connect them to your Intune data, and share them in your organization. They are also available here for download as Power BI template files, allowing you to modify them or use them as the basis for your own custom reports. Both current and previous versions of these template files are available.
